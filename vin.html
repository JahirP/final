        <h4>Fun facts</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Sinclair began going by his stage name "Vin Diesel" while working as a bouncer at the New York nightclub Tunnel, wanting a tougher sounding name for his occupation. Vin comes from his mother's married last name Vincent, while the surname Diesel came from his friends due to his tendency to be energetic.</li>
        <li>Diesel got his big break when director Steven Spielberg, who had seen Multi-Facial, cast him in the award-winning Saving Private Ryan (1998). With his appealing screen presence—shaved head, muscular physique, raspy voice, and rough-hewn charm—Diesel was soon working regularly</li>
        <li>He grew up in the West Village's Westbeth, the nation's first federally subsidized arts colony, and he was obsessed with Dungeons and Dragons, Time magazine reported. When he was 7, Diesel, his fraternal twin, Paul, and some friends broke into Manhattan's Theater for the New City for a good time</li>
